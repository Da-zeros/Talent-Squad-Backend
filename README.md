### Project Description

Back-end challenge offered by [Talent Squad](https://barcelonadigitaltalent.com/talent-squad/) through the [NUWE](https://nuwe.io/dev) challenge platform.
API that simulates a job offer site where you can list, filter offers by type and in the case of companies create delete and edit all their fields.

### Used technologies
